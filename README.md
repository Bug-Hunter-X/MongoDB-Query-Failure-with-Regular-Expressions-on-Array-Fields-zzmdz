# MongoDB Query Failure with Regular Expressions on Array Fields

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with MongoDB queries and regular expressions involving array fields.  The issue arises when attempting a case-insensitive search using a regular expression against a field that may contain an array of strings instead of a single string.  The provided solution illustrates how to correctly handle this scenario.

## Problem

The original query uses a regular expression for case-insensitive matching on the `name` field. If the `name` field is an array, the query fails. This scenario often leads to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Solution

The solution uses the `$in` operator or `$elemMatch` to handle arrays and searches for a matching element that satisfies the regular expression. This approach ensures that the query operates as intended, even when dealing with arrays.
